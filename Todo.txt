Functionality:

    Take in workout info thgough a gui and store it in csv files as a basic database

    Each person should have a dir of files of their progress

    user sign in
        password in future maybe

    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    track bodyweight so it can be an added stat when looking back (especially helpful for bodyweight exercises)

    custom datastructure for handling the data

    data stored in csv format

    each workout day is a separate file

    csv date section will keep track to the day

    if dir for user doesnt exist create a dir for the user
        check disregarding case

    csv format:
        date,bodyweight,exercise,sets,reps

    graph results eventually:
        not the highest priority at least at the begining

    look into using css with the gui to make it look good
        -css
