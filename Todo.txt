    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    in graphs be able to filter by exercise

    add wods as an exercise, time is now required
        -workout should be a super class and the different ones should inherit from then add on to (Strength, wod, walking)
            -within wod: should be an enum of the different wods i have
                -should eventually come up with own
        -will need refactoring to handle these new type of workouts
