Functionality:

    get working first then refactor



    option for range to start at zero on graph

    should handle one datapoint better

    make exercise an enum
        -replace all places that use exercise

    make onExitInfo a cfg

    use csv code from budget here

    centralize the main data

    make the gui things extetend the object instead on the weird init thing they do now

    review situations when fields are required / not required based on exercise selection

    Restricted textfield
        -takes regex

    Only need one workout file, no need for the date to be the title, treat like a database

    Date should be a datepicker

    look at todos from budget to get todo ideas



    display:
        -specific workouts
        -overall
            -volume
            -reps

        over time:
            -select time range

        -show volume for each bodypart group mapped out
            -all groups on same map
            -shows where you should add or subtract volume




    user sign in
        password in future maybe

    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    graph results eventually:
        not the highest priority at least at the beginning

    look into using css with the gui to make it look good
        -css

    Make exercises into enums and say if they need to include the bodyweight into the volume equation

    add wods as an exercise, time is now required
        -workout should be a super class and the different ones should inherit from then add on to (Strength, wod, walking)
            -within wod: should be an enum of the different wods i have
                -should eventually come up with own
        -will need refactoring to handle these new type of workouts
            -make more general and call more functions from the super class


    Aditional actions:

        Button:
            Display data Button:
                -opens window with display options
                    -options should be in a listview with a button under called show
                        -when show is pressed the selected option should be shown


            Admin button:
                -add user
                    -upon creating a new user make a log dir for them
                    -after user added reload the users in the combo box

            Delete entry / user button:
                -opens a windows explorer window and lets you do it yourself or opens list view window and lets you delete from list view
