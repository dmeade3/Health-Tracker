Functionality:

    user sign in
        password in future maybe

    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    graph results eventually:
        not the highest priority at least at the beginning

    look into using css with the gui to make it look good
        -css

    after user added reload the users in the combo box

    eventually save the most recently used user as the first one selected on startup / same with bodyweight

    refactor so there is a real main and maingrid and other pages have their own class

    In app when tracking weight take Average of week as progress result, option

    find out how to make a line graph with multiple lines
        -wil have to do some refactoring

    add wods as an exercise, time is now required
        -workout should be a super class and the different ones should inherit from then add on to (Strength, wod, walking)
            -within wod: should be an enum of the different wods i have
                -should eventually come up with own
        -will need refactoring to handle these new type of workouts
            -make more general and call more functions from the super class
