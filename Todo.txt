Priority:

    use a excel spreadsheet for issue tracking
        -load these issues into the excel



Planning: <-- this will be all that stays

    -need admin panel at top with refresh button
        -main tab pane hols list all objects
            -might need to make custom tab interface with refresh method
        when refresh pressed it will go throught the list and refresh the data


    -Data Handling:
        Refresh button clicked / app loaded:
            data csv's updated



    -Each tab should be completely independent
    -Design with extension and other future apps in mind
        -make basic as possible down until it has to be specific



    Manage Health Data:

        -5 min increments is what it seems to be returning from fitbit

                -Exercise

            Fitbit:
                -Steps
                -Floors
                -Sleep
                -Water

                -Calories eaten
                -Cals Left to Eat
                    -either get from fitbit or calc on own
                    -say if withing goal or not
                -Heart Rate
                -Health Goals
                    -mostly graphs showing progress
                    -like budget app have a line of progress bars showing progress towards the goal
                    -make a goal object with a start and end and get percentage complete method
                    -have special scene if the goal is complete
                -break down info for macro nutrients eaten that day on the nutrition page

            Withings:

                -Weight
                -BodyFat
                -Water%
                -Bone Mass
                -Blood Pressure
                -Pulse Wave Velocity


    Manage Fitness Data:
        -prs
        -Something for running
        -lifting goals


    Maybe Future manage misc data:
        -random little things that could be in a tab
        -app knows my shows i like and gets info on them
            -which season is out / episode
            -maybe where i am in the show
            -when is airing next































first tackle the data storing problem
    reliably store data
        -read write
            -dont store duplicates
            -csv style
            -make all fitbit objects extend an interface:
                -write out
                -string format for writing out
                -parse line


will still have to log blood presaure and scale info
    -work on getting info for these like fitbit does

get log4j.properties to work

-make task for every time compiled to run sonarqube

when showing prs, they should be in a table format, only able to show one exercise and its always all time

datadisplay page format buttons like main

gradually pass the show graph button more data till it is completely customizable

use csv code from budget here

some fields should be search fields like exercise
    -dont currently know how to do this

review situations when fields are required / not required based on exercise selection
    -for exercise logging

Restricted textfield
    -takes regex
        -enum of restriction options
    -use everywhere

Should have stats for whole workout (Day volume all added up)

improve aesthetics of the program

look at todos from budget to get todo ideas

place for goals and theres charts showing progress towards goal
    -weight goal
    -lifting goal
        -volume reps with weight

overall stats:
    all total volume
    total all reps
    total all sets
    mention earliest workout entry date

display:
    -specific workouts
    -overall
        -volume
        -reps

    over time:
        -select time range
