Functionality:

    dont use jfreechart, use javafx charts


    get working first then refactor



    load my exercises into enum

    exercise drop down use exercise name not the enum name
        -but should still hold an exercise Object not a string

    option for range to start at zero on graph

    should handle one datapoint better

    make exercise an enum
        -replace all places that use exercise

    use csv code from budget here

    centralize the main data

    make the gui things extetend the object instead on the weird init thing they do now

    review situations when fields are required / not required based on exercise selection
        -for exercise logging

    Restricted textfield
        -takes regex
            -enum of restriction options
        -use everywhere

    Date should be a datepicker

    look at todos from budget to get todo ideas



    display:
        -specific workouts
        -overall
            -volume
            -reps

        over time:
            -select time range

        -show volume for each bodypart group mapped out
            -all groups on same map
            -shows where you should add or subtract volume

    user sign in
        password in future maybe

    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    look into using css with the gui to make it look good
        -css
        -budget css

    add wods as an exercise, time is now required
        -workout should be a super class and the different ones should inherit from then add on to (Strength, wod, walking)
            -within wod: should be an enum of the different wods i have
                -should eventually come up with own
        -will need refactoring to handle these new type of workouts
            -make more general and call more functions from the super class
