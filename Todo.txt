    Make exercises into enums and say if they need to include the bodyweight into the volume equation

    add wods as an exercise, time is now required
        -workout should be a super class and the different ones should inherit from then add on to (Strength, wod, walking)
            -within wod: should be an enum of the different wods i have
                -should eventually come up with own
