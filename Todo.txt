Priority:

    use a excel spreadsheet for issue tracking
        -edit down issue tracking
        -load these issues into the excel
        -color the issues
        
    -finish rename of project

    -use sonar cube
        -make scripts for starting my sonarqube

    -make full screen sized



    after
        -make everything inside a tabbed pane
            -make it the main object
            -make custom tabs extendning tab for:
                -sleep
                -cals burned
                ...
                or
                    -fitbit
                    - withings
                    ...








Planning: <-- this will be all that stays

    -Design with extansion and other future apps in mind
        -make basic as possible down until it has to be specific


    -each tab should be completely independent

    Manage Health Data:
        -Floors
        -Cals Burned
        -Heart Rate
        -Resting Heart Rate
        -Velocity thing for withings scale
        -Weight
        -Blood Pressure
        -Steps
        -Health Goals
            -mostly graphs showing progress
            -like budget app have a line of progress bars showing progress towards the goal
            -make a goal object with a start and end and get percentage complete method
            -have special scene if the goal is complete






    Manage Fitness Data:
        -prs
        -Something for running
        -lifting goals


    Maybe Future manage misc data:
        -random little things that could be in a tab
        -app knows my shows i like and gets info on them
            -which season is out / episode
            -maybe where i am in the show
            -when is airing next


All that is tracked:

    Goals:
        -Steps Per day


    By hand:
        -Blood Preasure

    Fitbit:
        -Steps
        -Floors
        -Sleep
        -Water
        -Resting Heart Rate
        -Calories Burned
        -Active Minutes
            -Catagory of activity

    My Fitness Pal:

        -Calories Eaten



    Withings:

        -Weight
        -BodyFat
        -Water%
        -Bone Mass
        -




first tackle the data storing problem
    reliably store data
        -read write
            -dont store duplicates
            -csv style
            -make all fitbit objects extend an interface:
                -write out
                -string format for writing out
                -parse line


color like fitbit
    -make whole screan app

foramt very closely to fitbit

tab for charts and tab for data selection and viewing within a tableview

Eventual goal is to expand the the main pat of the app into a tabbed pane:
    pr / workout tracking pane
    health pane

        all fitbit info

            tabs within this tab
                -steps
                -Heart:
                    withings pulse thing
                    resting heart rate

                -sleep
                -cals burned

    Something for running


will still have to log blood presaure and scale info
    -work on getting info for these like fitbit does

find safe way to store password and username


when showing prs, they should be in a table format, only able to show one exercise and its always all time

datadisplay page format buttons like main

gradually pass the show graph button more data till it is completely customizable

use csv code from budget here

some fields should be search fields like exercise
    -dont currently know how to do this

review situations when fields are required / not required based on exercise selection
    -for exercise logging

Restricted textfield
    -takes regex
        -enum of restriction options
    -use everywhere

Should have stats for whole workout (Day volume all added up)

improve aesthetics of the program

look at todos from budget to get todo ideas

place for goals and theres charts showing progress towards goal
    -weight goal
    -lifting goal
        -volume reps with weight

search specific prs

be able to show total volum per workout

overall stats:
    all total volume
    total all reps
    total all sets
    mention earliest workout entry date

display:
    -specific workouts
    -overall
        -volume
        -reps

    over time:
        -select time range

user sign in
    password in future maybe

choose timespan of a week, month, day for each column when displaying data

make with jar so launchable like a real app so i can distribute easy if someone else wants it like josh or brian
