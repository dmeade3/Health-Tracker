Functionality:

    Take in workout info through a gui and store it in csv files as a basic database

    user sign in
        password in future maybe

    able to read in data and use it to give back results / progress / stats on workouts (total weight moved)

    track bodyweight so it can be an added stat when looking back (especially helpful for bodyweight exercises)

    upon creating a new user make a log dir for them

    csv format:
        date,bodyweight,exercise,sets,reps,time
            -time can be blank
            -error if the others are blank

    graph results eventually:
        not the highest priority at least at the beginning

    look into using css with the gui to make it look good
        -css

    Message if the user doesnt exist
